# CS-230-Module-Eight-Journal

The gaming room, a software developmenmt company, was desiring to make a web based port of their android game, Draw it or lose it. For this, I think I did very well at ensuring that my software was secure, and had no vulnerabilities for websocket connections. I found that creating the design document was helpful for making me work through all the steps in the correct order, and ensuring every change I made was both properly documented and in a format that is easily readible for other people, as well so that even I would be able to reference it later with ease. I don't really have any problems with my document that I feel concerened with, I feel like I met the proper expectations everywhere I needed to, and am fully satisfied with my work. As for how I interpetted The Gaming Room's needs, I simply read what The Gaming Room requested throughoughly and made sure that everything was done exactly as they needed. If I could have asked more questions about what they needed of me, that would have been more helpful, but since that wasn't an option for this project, I feel I did the best I could with what I was given.
